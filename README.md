This is a starter kit for wordpress theme and plugins devleop. It's a result of many projects and template that was built over the years.

## Assets

I'm compilng all the theme assets using a library called [wpack.io](https://wpack.io/)

#### JS:
check the Index.js file in canaan theme folder. the idea behind this structre is to gernate one big JS file that will be cached. each page will have a JS class that will be loaded only if a certain DOM elment is in the page.

#### CSS:
im using 
1. Reset CSS completely
1. SCSS for spliting files. have a look in the style.scss for better understaing of the structe.
